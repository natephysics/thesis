In conclusion, this thesis presents a successful approach for inferring the edge rotational transform, $\bar{\iota}$, of the Wendelstein 7-X plasma experiment from heat load data. By training an inceptnet convolutional neural network on a dataset of infrared camera images, the network was able to infer the edge rotational transform with an $rmse$ of $4.13 \cdot 10^{-3}$. This is an improvement over prior work with similar data and indicates that the proposed approach is a viable solution for determining real-time extraction of $\bar{\iota}$ from the W7-X experiment. Since the network was trained on inputs with a 520x130 resolution, which is a good compromise between computational cost and network performance, further improvements can be quickly made by expanding the dataset, both in size and maybe with completely simulated labels for the gaps in the output $/bar{/iota}$ distribution.
