\section{Prior work from Böckenhoff}

The topic of this thesis was built upon the work of many of colleagues at IPP. Daniel Böckenhoff's work in his 2018 paper \cite{Böckenhoff_2018} he demonstrates that artificial neural networks can be used to predict $I_B$, the coil current from the $B$-coils (seen in the following diagram \ref{fig:3}), the from heat load in the experiment. Instead of the divetors that are currently installed on the experiment, the data used was from the prior experimental campaign, which used a limiter \ref{fig:limiter}. A limiter is a piece of graphite designed interface with the plasma to prevent it from interacting with the wall, potentially damaging the wall surface.
